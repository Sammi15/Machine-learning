# Regression Model Training Code

This repository contains the code for training a regression model. The model is designed to predict a continuous target variable based on a set of input features. The code provided here demonstrates how to preprocess the data, train the regression model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/regression-model-training.git
cd regression-model-training
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare the data:

   - Place your training data in the `data` directory.
   - Modify the `data_preprocessing.py` file to preprocess the data according to your specific requirements. This may include handling missing values, scaling features, or encoding categorical variables.

4. Train the regression model:

   - Open the `train_model.py` file and modify the code to specify the appropriate input and output file paths, model parameters, and training configurations.
   - Run the following command to start the training process:

     ```bash
     python train_model.py
     ```

   - The trained model will be saved to the specified output file path.

5. Evaluate the model:

   - Open the `evaluate_model.py` file and modify the code to specify the path to the trained model and the evaluation data.
   - Run the following command to evaluate the model's performance:

     ```bash
     python evaluate_model.py
     ```

   - The evaluation results, such as mean squared error or R-squared, will be displayed.
